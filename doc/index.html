<b>Dynamis</b> is a small software package for studying coupled dynamical systems, i.e. systems of ordinary differential equations with local connections (by diffusion) on a rectangular grid.
<BR><BR>
Dynamis is written in C (in a mock object-oriented style of using function pointers). It contains a numerical ODE solver (Runge-Kutta method) and produces PNG images that can be combined in a video. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dynamis/"> project page for mercurial repository</a>
<BR><BR>
Dynamis was an undergraduate research project in 2001.
The main purpose of the project was to observe emergent phenomena in a minimalistic settings.

The system starts from disorder, a completely random initial distribution.
